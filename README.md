# Bailey's grid collection

Bailey's grid collection is a collection of 3 different games that are grid-based that are classics. Like 2048, a merging game and a simple match of noughts of crosses (tictactoe).

# 2048

A very simple 2048 game, that you know and love, slide the blocks across so that you can multiply your numbers to get higher and higher! See the highest score you can possibly get!

# Merge City 

Merge city is another game here where you have some items that can spawn that you have to merge to get better and better items, right now there is like cheeseburgers, kfc, gibiASMR, my friend, summer of making and other tings you can merge, you can play to find them all out!

# Noughts and crosses

You already know what noughts and crosses is, or tictactoe for you americans out there, its a simple game where you have to get 3 in a row (or diagonal) to win the game, beat the bot and win bragging rights to your friends that you are better than a very simple coded bot that uses the same moves every single time based on your current move!

# Uhh yea

I hope you enjoy, I was kinda out of ideas for this week but yh
